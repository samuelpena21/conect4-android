The players present a chip per turn in the column they wish, the chip falls in the lowest possible position of the column until they are filled. The winner is the one who makes the first alignment (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of 4 tiles of their color. if all the spaces of the game grid took away and no player has managed to make an alignment, the game is tied.</string>
